#Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis

Overview:
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to predict product ratings (from 1 to 5) based on Amazon product reviews. 
The model uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean, preprocess, and analyze the textual data. The sentiment is classified using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. 
The project demonstrates a real-world use case for sentiment analysis and how it can be applied to customer reviews for product rating prediction.

#Requirements:

To run the project, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
nltk
tensorflow
sklearn

#Model Architecture

Simple RNN Model
A basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is built using the Keras Sequential API.An advanced LSTM model is also built using the Keras Sequential API.

#The Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis project successfully builds machine learning models that can predict product ratings based on customer reviews. The implementation demonstrates the following:

Data preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, tokenization, and padding.
Building and training RNN and LSTM models for text classification.
Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
This project provides a real-world example of how sentiment analysis can be applied to customer feedback for predictive analysis.
